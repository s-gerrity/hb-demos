These are some examples of documentation formats
you could make from tests.txt. It's nice to be able to
turn testable documentation into pretty docs.

This was done using the `docutils` software (for
example ``rst2html.py tests.txt > docs/tests.html``).

A more sophisticated project is `Sphinx`, which creates
entirely, beautifully-typeset manuals from formatted text.
Larger projects often use this, including Flask, Plone,
Django, and other sophisticated Python-based projects.
(This is also how Hackbright makes our slides and handouts!)
