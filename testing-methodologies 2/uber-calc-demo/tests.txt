Testing UberCalc
================

UberCalc is a whiz-bang application for doing complex math.

In order to test it, we need to do some basic setup::

    >>> from selenium import webdriver
    >>> browser = webdriver.Firefox()

First, the user will open the homepage of our app::

    >>> browser.get('http://localhost:5000')

Let's make sure we're really at the homepage::

    >>> browser.title
    u'UberCalc'

Good!

Let's get the "x" field; the first item we want to add::

    >>> x = browser.find_element_by_id('x-field')

And type 3 into that box::

   >>> x.send_keys("3")

And we'll do the same for "y", putting 4 in::

    >>> y = browser.find_element_by_id('y-field')
    >>> y.send_keys("4")

Then, let's find the "Calculate" button and click it::

    >>> btn = browser.find_element_by_id('calc-button')
    >>> btn.click()

We should get "7" in the results::

    >>> result = browser.find_element_by_id('result')
    >>> result.text
    u'7'

Great! Our application works. Let's close the browser
window we opened::

    >>> browser.quit()
