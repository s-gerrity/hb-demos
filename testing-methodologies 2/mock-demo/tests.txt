Our Awesome App
===============

AwesomeAppâ„¢ is a disruptive, thought-leading, growth-hacking application for
searching for employees. It's like the Uber of employee-finding apps.

First, let's get the stuff we need for our test::

    >>> import json
    >>> from server import app
    >>> from model import Employee, Department, connect_to_db, db, example_data
    >>> client = app.test_client()

We'll use a temporary database in our tests::

    >>> connect_to_db(app, 'postgresql:///testdb')

We'll put some sample data into it::

    >>> db.create_all()
    >>> example_data()

Let's make sure you can find an employee::

   >>> leonard = Employee.query.filter(Employee.name == "Leonard").first()
   >>> leonard.name
   'Leonard'

Let's test our find-employees-by-state::

Create mock response:

    >>> def _mock_state_to_code(state_name):
    ...     return "CA"
    >>> import server
    >>> server.state_to_code = _mock_state_to_code

   >>> r = client.get("/emps-by-state.json?state_name=California")
   >>> info = json.loads(r.data.decode('utf-8'))

We should find 4 employees:

   >>> len(info['CA']) == 4
   True

   >>> sorted([e['name'] for e in info['CA']])
   ['Leonard', 'Liz', 'Maggie', 'Nadine']
